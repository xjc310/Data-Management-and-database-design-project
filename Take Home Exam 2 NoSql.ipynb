They contain the tags(topic:games) we want to collect in social media and the detail infomation of each tag(eg,the name,studio,launch year of the game).The rest of the tables are the game details table.It contains the game id,twitter user id,tweets post time and tweets text.\n",

After that, we import CSV files in to mongoDB by using “mongoimport”, an official tool to make importing CSV, TSV, JSON simple and easy.\n",
